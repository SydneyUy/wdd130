<!--jpeg/jpg used for high resolustion images, photography in most case, png compresses the image and supports transparent files unlike jpeg. gif is used for animation or short videos. webp is a file type created by google that compresses the file much smalleer that png and even supports moving images, svg is used for logos icons and text that need to be scaled cleanly to any size. helc is a newer file type that compresses much better that jpeg. -->
